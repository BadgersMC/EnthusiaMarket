# Trust command shorthand correction

## Spec and prove

REQ-393 restores the advertised `/shop trust <player>` route. Native TEST pass2549 on
PR226 head967a30c reproduced `Unknown or incomplete command` for
`/shop trust FainNoir`; the explicit `menu` suffix opened the existing menu and
passed three-page navigation and canceled selection checks. This is observed
pre-fix failure evidence, not a claimed historical unit-test run.

Before editing, the isolated worktree was clean at967a30c and canonical main was
fetched again as57704f1acfaf8aacfdd65cb4ae74c0f36b55712d, unchanged from the
ongoing candidate's last base inspection. The existing TEST candidate remains
the integration scope; none of its accepted changes are replaced with an older
main-only JAR. Roundtable source intent2552 records the bounded continuation.

## Engine and architecture

The pinned Nexus registrar does not dispatch Kotlin default arguments. An
explicit player-name-only handler delegates to the same `menu` path as the
existing mode handler. The mode is required only on that second overload.
Name resolution, owner scope, base permission, console rejection, explicit
`all`, menu selection and confirmation-only persistence remain in their
existing adapters/services. No GUI layout, language, schema, companion API,
inventory or economy behavior changes.

## Refine and delivery

ShopTrustCommandRegistrationTest scans the real command class and invokes the
actual pinned Nexus-built Brigadier tree. It covers the shorthand and explicit
menu reaching the same unknown-player validation without persistence, explicit
all with the resolved target, permission denial, console rejection, missing
player and excess arguments. Existing GUI tests cover opening, selection and
confirmation behavior; native acceptance of the new build is a separate gate.

Local and canonical CI results, source/artifact pins, review and TEST deployment
receipts are recorded on PR226 and in the local bridge evidence. Pending checks
are not implied to have passed. No repository-local EARS validator or SPEAR
state helper exists; these requirement/task/evidence files track the workflow.
Production and merging remain outside the authorized TEST deployment.

The local Java25 focused run passed all six cases (four new registrar cases and
two help-contract cases), with zero failures/errors/skips. The first local
attempt lacked the configured companion path. After selecting the cached,
workflow-hash-verified LumaGuilds3.0.39 JAR, an actor-UUID matcher mistake in the
new test was corrected and the focused run passed. No pre-patch unit red run is
claimed. Canonical CI and the deployed companion contract remain separate.

The unchanged menu can be explored in the existing
[interactive pagination simulation](https://enthusia-market-pagination-review.awareyak.chatgpt.site/).
It is a simulation and does not prove command registration or native rendering.

## Verified TEST follow-up

Source615fff9 passed canonical run41115116315: 1,146 tests executed, zero
failures/errors, one unchanged opt-in remote-authentication skip. All four new
registrar cases executed. Artifact13004399521 was independently verified and
activated under fresh Staff/Guilds acknowledgments in pass2556. A fresh runtime
receipt confirms the enabled artifact hash recorded in market-release-acceptance.md.

FainNeito ran `/shop trust FainNoir` without a mode argument on TEST. The existing
one-shop trust menu opened, then was canceled with Escape without selection or
Confirm. Exact database bytes, all 33 table fingerprints and configuration
matched the offline pre-deployment backup afterward. This proves command routing
and cancellation, not a trust-confirmation or ordinary-player permission test.
Source remains unmerged and production unchanged.
