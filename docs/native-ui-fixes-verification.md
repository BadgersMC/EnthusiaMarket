# Native UI corrections — 2026-10-30

## Spec and prove

REQ-390/391/392 refine the existing Market management flows. Current authoritative main was fetched as 57704f1acfaf8aacfdd65cb4ae74c0f36b55712d; ongoing PR226 started at 1db4f6346484e8f35812130f697f91d684caa11a. The cloud worker explicitly released source/build ownership because its executor was unavailable. Local Roundtable MARKET intent2508 records the isolated source-only continuation; no TEST/client resources are held.

Native TEST pass2504 observed an incomplete `/shop delete` command, previous SELL results remaining visible after an empty BUY transition, and the selected-shop tooltip showing `{true}`. This is behavioral failure evidence on the preceding TEST candidate, not an invented pre-patch unit-test run. The preserved pass report is https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n5W-kiy8SGJSZlcdwJjapnveldBAv0hE/view.

## Engine and architecture

- The actual Nexus registrar ignores Kotlin argument defaults. An explicit zero-argument delete route delegates to the existing menu path. The explicit mode route and its delete-all permission check remain intact.
- Search filter callbacks mark an in-menu transition. Only that path closes an empty results inventory; initial empty searches still preserve unrelated inventories. Direction, stock filtering, sorting, navigation and result actions retain their existing semantics.
- Bulk trust converts localized selection labels to plain text before passing the existing `sel` placeholder. This preserves custom icon templates without emitting a boolean or depending on component-placeholder support. Confirmation remains the only persistence action.

Changes remain within command/GUI adapters, language resources, focused tests and documentation. No schema, accounting, stock mutation, companion API, dependency or permission-policy changes. The repository has no local EARS validator or SPEAR state helper; manual requirement/task/evidence records are maintained.

## Refine and delivery

Authored regressions exercise the actual Nexus-built Brigadier tree (bare/explicit delete, additional delete-all permission, console/base-permission rejection), actual GUI clicks for empty direction and stock transitions, and both readable trust states without premature persistence. Existing coverage preserves initial empty-search inventories and cross-page confirmation.

First canonical run41094145043 executed 1,144 cases with one failure and one unchanged external-authentication skip. The failure was the existing help contract choosing one arbitrary handler for the overloaded delete path; the actual registrar and GUI regressions passed. The contract now accepts an arity-compatible handler at the longest matching command path. This retains rejection of invalid help syntax while supporting the actual command tree.

Codacy on refinement head11b3056 completed with zero annotations after resolving documentation spacing, method length and test-class count findings. Final-head canonical execution counts, checks and review receipts are recorded on [PR226](https://github.com/BadgersMC/EnthusiaMarket/pull/226). No local JVM build is claimed for this initial correction. Subsequent separately authorized TEST activation and pass2529 verified bare delete, empty-filter closure and readable trust labels; pass2549 verified high-count pagination and zero-stock feedback. Current source/runtime pins and remaining acceptance are reconciled in market-release-acceptance.md. No merge or production operation occurred.

## Interactive artifact

[Native menu fixes preview](https://enthusia-market-native-fixes-review.xxnatetheprogamerxx.chatgpt.site) is an owner-private, published simulation. Browser actions exercised bare-delete opening and second-click deletion with refreshed results, empty BUY-filter closure/feedback, readable trust toggling and explicit confirmation. At 390px, no horizontal overflow was observed; alternative controls are 46px tall. Language YAML parses and preserves the custom-template `sel` placeholder; preview JavaScript syntax passes.

Hosted access reaches the ChatGPT owner sign-in gate in the available browser. Authenticated hosted/mobile-device rendering is unverified. The preview uses schematic icons and is not native Minecraft acceptance; it cannot change a server shop.
