# Rent

Every stall you own costs rent. If you don't pay, you lose the stall. Here's how it works.

## How rent is calculated

Rent depends on the server's config:

### Formula mode (default)

```text
dailyRent = purchasePrice × rentPct%
```

Example: you bought a stall for $10,000. At 1%, your daily rent is $100.

### Flat mode

```text
dailyRent = flatAmount
```

Same amount per period regardless of what the stall cost. Example: $500/day flat.

## When rent is due

Rent is **not charged automatically**. Renew from the stall purchase sign before `nextRentAt`. The rent scheduler checks due stalls on the configured **collection interval** (default: every 24 hours) and enforces grace/auction state; it does not withdraw rent from your balance.

## What happens if you can't pay

If the stall reaches its due time without a successful renewal:

1. Your stall enters **GRACE** state — a warning period.
2. During grace, the stall **and all its shops are frozen**. No trades can happen until rent is paid.
3. You have a **grace period** (default 3 days) to pay rent.
4. If you pay rent during grace, the stall unfreezes and you return to OWNED in good standing.
5. If the grace period expires without payment: the stall goes to **emergency auction**,
   starting at minimum the outstanding rent balance. Any player can bid.

## How to pay or extend rent

**Right-click the purchase sign twice** within 10 seconds (the confirmation window). Each double-click extends rent by one period.

An authorized personal stall member can also renew rent. The person confirming pays from their own balance; insufficient funds or a failed persistence update must not grant an unpaid extension. Check the amount shown before confirming. Guild rent follows the guild's bank and access rules.

You can pre-pay multiple periods ahead — the config option `rent.maxPrepaidPeriods` controls the cap (0 = unlimited).

## Check your rent status

Use the purchase sign — the fourth line shows your remaining rent time in `dd:hh:mm:ss` format.

Or run:

```text
/em stall info <stallId>
```
