# Candidate review refinement

The combined candidate's first hosted run compiled and packaged successfully. It reported 1,138 tests, zero failures/errors and three skips. Its exact source tree was af0356bb38f750a874d05c17bf2e3a84afec1bf3.

## Spec and proof

The manifest must fail closed under Python optimization and reject malformed or entity-bearing XML. The Cloud refinement passed 24 focused subprocess cases; application behavior still requires this head's hosted checks. Existing auction confirmation, token, player and timeout checks remain in order.

## Engine and architecture

The two previously environment-gated journal/accounting tests now use the existing per-class MarketMariaDbFixture. The established fixture owns each container or unique native loopback schema and cleanup. V031 journal assertions and V033 FIFO, replay and rollback assertions are preserved. CI requires both suites to execute without skips, failures or errors. External authentication remains explicitly deferred.

## Refinement and limits

Cloud execution became unavailable after clean commit 2e90d63af5c0ba01ab638beafcb0f78c6d3c30b6. The small fixture wiring and CI gates were prepared as a text-only GitHub bridge delta, without a local plugin checkout or JVM build. Exact-head CI is pending. No TEST deployment, production change or native client acceptance is claimed. Existing pagination, access-label and auction previews remain simulations of unchanged visual behavior.

The remaining analysis pass requested the standard defusedxml parser. CI installs version 0.7.1 from a hash-pinned wheel into its own temporary virtual environment; DTD, entity and external resolution are explicitly forbidden. The manifest fixtures retain normal and optimized subprocess checks. Auction chat extraction uses a captured claim object while retaining token consumption, player identity, timeout and review order. Exact-head validation remains pending.

Hosted run 40993595275 exposed the existing successful-capture fixture race at BedrockHeadStoreTest line 33: completeHash publishes the URL under its lock, then invokes the notification callback after releasing it. The test now uses its existing queued worker fence before asserting notification and pending-file cleanup. This establishes worker completion and memory visibility without changing production code or removing assertions. Exact-head rerun remains required.
